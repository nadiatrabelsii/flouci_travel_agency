# Travel Agency Platform

A Django-based travel agency platform designed for users to explore travel packages, receive personalized recommendations, and interact with an intelligent chatbot for travel-related assistance. This platform integrates Celery for task management, PostgreSQL for the database, and the OpenAI API for chatbot functionality.

---

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Travel Package Browsing**:
  - View detailed descriptions, pricing, and themes.
- **Personalized Recommendations**:
  - Receive recommendations based on user clicks and feedback, focusing on package similarity.
- **Chatbot Integration**:
  - Ask travel-related queries and get real-time responses using OpenAI.

### Backend and Infrastructure
- **Celery Task Management**:
  - Asynchronous task handling for email notifications and recommendations.
- **PostgreSQL Database**:
  - Robust database for travel packages, user feedback, and activity tracking.
- **REST API Ready**:
  - Extendable with Django REST Framework for additional integrations.
